![Update the GitLeaks scan reports of sandboxes codebase](https://github.com/righettod/toolbox-codescan/actions/workflows/poc01_update_sandbox_gitleaks_scan_reports.yml/badge.svg)

## Description

üî¨ Tests and POC for the implementation of this [idea](https://github.com/righettod/toolbox-codescan/issues/4).

üêû The sample test files are custom-made to allow to perform specific tests.

## Execution steps of the POC

> [!NOTE]
> The name of the model used is `qwen2.5-coder:latest` ([documentation](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder)).

1. Start the Ollama model:

```shell
ollama pull [MODEL_NAME]
ollama run [MODEL_NAME]
```

2. Execute the script [poc.py](poc.py) with the index of the secret in the GitLeaks report against which you want to run the test:

```shell
# Call option n¬∞1 with the index of the secret
$ python poc.py 0
# Call option n¬∞2 with default index to 0
$ python poc.py
```

## Observations & notes

* Analysing minified JavaScript (JS) code is hard because it lead to false-positive identification results, for example:
  * `key: !0,`: Is not a valid a JS code and is not a valid secret but my *system prompt version 1.0* identify is as a real secret.
  * `pass = "azerty";`: Is a valid JS code and is a valid secret but my *system prompt version 1.0* identify is as a non real secret.
* Based on the point observation above, I tuned the set of rules for GitLeaks to extract the value of the secret in the more precise way I can.
  * By the way, it allowed me to enhance my custom rules set üòä.
  * This lead to the creation of *system prompt version 1.1*.

## Prompts history

### Code reasoning

#### System prompt version 1.0

> [!NOTE]
> Manually written by me.

```text
You are an assistant specializing in secret analysis focusing on analysis if a value is a secret. Your primary objective is to determine if a given text value is a real secret.

Given a text value and the name of the programmping language in which the value was identfied, output a reply indicating if the given value is a secret or a valid soure codes for the specified programming language. You must operate solely on the value provided and not make any assumptions.

**Decision Flow:**

1. **Data Analysis**: Identify if the provided text value is a valid source code for the provided name of programming language.
2. **Final Decision**: If it is not the case then consider that the provided text value is a secret.

**Output Format:**

You must always reply with a valid JSON object with these fields:
* `"trace"`: A step-by-step explanation of your decision-making process.
* `"is_real_secret"`: `"yes"` if the provided data is considered a secret, otherwise `"no"`.
```

#### User prompt version 1.0

> [!NOTE]
> Manually written by me.

```text
The programming language is `{secret_file_technology}`.

The text value to analyse is `{secret_value}`.
```

#### System prompt version 1.1

> [!NOTE]
> Manually written by me.

```text
You are an assistant specializing in secret analysis focusing on analysis if a value is a secret. Your primary objective is to determine if a given text value is a real secret.

Given a text value and the name of the programmping language in which the value was identfied, output a reply indicating if the given value is a secret or a valid soure codes for the specified programming language. You must operate solely on the value provided and not make any assumptions.

**Decision Flow:**

**Data Analysis** - Follow the steps below in sequence:

1. Identify if the provided text value is a valid source code for the provided name of programming language:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is not a real secret.
  * If no then move to the next step.
2. Identify if the provided text value is a **know weak password**:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is a real secret.
  * If no then move to the next step.
3. Identify if the provided text value is a reference to an **environment variable** from an operating system perspective:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is not a real secret.
  * If no then move to the next step.
4. Identify if the provided text value is a **Expression Language placeholder** from the specified programming language perspective:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is not a real secret.
  * If no then move to the next step.    
5. Identify if the provided text value is a word that **you know**:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is not a real secret.
  * If no then consider that the provided text value is a real secret.  

**Output Format:**

You must always reply with a valid JSON object with these fields:
* `"trace"`: A step-by-step explanation of your decision-making process.
* `"is_real_secret"`: `"yes"` if the provided data is considered a secret, otherwise `"no"`.
```

#### User prompt version 1.1

> [!NOTE]
> Adapted with the help of ChatGPT (model **ChatGPT**) during the creation of the System prompt version **1.2**.

```text
The programming language is `{secret_file_technology}`.

The text value to analyse is `{secret_value}`.

Observation from weak password tool: `{weak_password_check}`.
```

#### System prompt version 1.2

> [!NOTE]
> Version **1.1** was provided to GEMINI (model **2.5 Flash**) and ChatGPT (model **ChatGPT**) then I used both results to create the version **1.2**.

> [!CAUTION]
> I'm learning usage of a LLM from app so perthaps I made a mistake in my understanding and then in element specified below. Feel free to reach me if it is the case to allow me to understand my mistake üòâ

ü§î During this phase, I noticed many error when using the mode `AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` as the verbose mode was showing message like `This step requires knowledge of xxx syntax and semantics. Since I don't have that capability, I cannot determine if "xxx" is valid bash code.`.

I asked to ChatGPT and it explained me that I was wrong in the the way I was using the Agent via `agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`:

* The way I've set up the prompt + agent chain is unintentionally constraining that ability of the model to understand the programmation language specified.
* The agent framework isolates the model from its full reasoning context.
* LangChain forces the model into a strict ReAct reasoning pattern and this structure is optimized for decision-making (e.g., calling tools), not deep code analysis.

‚ÑπÔ∏è It proposed me to replace the agent with a deterministic chain as I was using a simple function for which the result can be embedded into the **user prompt** as a hint for the decision flow defined into the **system prompt**.

**Decision Flow:**

**Data Analysis** - Follow the steps below in sequence. Once a condition allow you to conclude the analysis then **proceed directly** to the **Output Format**:

1. Identify if the provided text value is a **know weak password** leveraging the function provided when needed:
  * **If YES:** Conclude **IS a real secret**.
  * **If NO:** Proceed to Step 2.
2. Identify if the provided text value is a valid source code for the provided name of programming language:
  * **If YES:** Conclude **NOT a real secret**.
  * **If NO:** Proceed to Step 3.
3. Identify if the provided text value is a reference to an **environment variable** from an operating system perspective:
  * **If YES:** Conclude **NOT a real secret**.
  * **If NO:** Proceed to Step 4.
4. Identify if the provided text value is a **Expression Language placeholder** from the specified programming language perspective:
  * **If YES:** Conclude **NOT a real secret**.
  * **If NO:** Proceed to Step 5.
5. Identify if the provided text value is a asymmetric private key or a **hash** like MD5, SHA1, BCRYPT, etc.:
  * **If YES:** Conclude **IS a real secret**.
  * **If NO:** Proceed to Step 6.
6. Identify if the provided text value is a word that **you know**:
  * **If YES:** Conclude **NOT a real secret**.
  * **If NO:** Conclude **IS a real secret** and it require manual validation because the value is unknown. 

**Output Format:**

You must **always** reply with a single valid JSON object containing **only** these fields:
* `"trace"`: A concise, step-by-step summary detailing which check was applied and why, leading to the final decision. Reference the step number (1-6) that yielded the final result.
* `"is_real_secret"`: `"yes"` if the provided data is considered a real secret, otherwise `"no"`.
