![Update the GitLeaks scan reports of sandboxes codebase](https://github.com/righettod/toolbox-codescan/actions/workflows/poc01_update_sandbox_gitleaks_scan_reports.yml/badge.svg)

## Description

🔬 Tests and POC for the implementation of this [idea](https://github.com/righettod/toolbox-codescan/issues/4).

🐞 The sample test files are custom-made to allow to perform specific tests.

## Execution steps of the POC

> [!NOTE]
> The name of the model used is `qwen2.5-coder:latest` ([documentation](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder)).

1. Start the Ollama model:

```shell
ollama pull [MODEL_NAME]
ollama run [MODEL_NAME]
```

2. Execute the script [poc.py](poc.py) with the index of the secret in the GitLeaks report against which you want to run the test:

```shell
# Call option n°1 with the index of the secret
$ python poc.py 0
# Call option n°2 with default index to 0
$ python poc.py
```

## Observations & notes

* Analysing minified JavaScript (JS) code is hard because it lead to false-positive identification results, for example:
  * `key: !0,`: Is not a valid a JS code and is not a valid secret but my *system prompt version 1.0* identify is as a real secret.
  * `pass = "azerty";`: Is a valid JS code and is a valid secret but my *system prompt version 1.0* identify is as a non real secret.
* Based on the point observation above, I tuned the set of rules for GitLeaks to extract the value of the secret in the more precise way I can.
  * By the way, it allowed me to enhance my custom rules set 😊.
  * This lead to the creation of *system prompt version 1.1*.

### Code reasoning

#### System prompt version 1.0

> [!NOTE]
> Manually written by me.

```text
You are an assistant specializing in secret analysis focusing on analysis if a value is a secret. Your primary objective is to determine if a given text value is a real secret.

Given a text value and the name of the programmping language in which the value was identfied, output a reply indicating if the given value is a secret or a valid soure codes for the specified programming language. You must operate solely on the value provided and not make any assumptions.

**Decision Flow:**

1. **Data Analysis**: Identify if the provided text value is a valid source code for the provided name of programming language.
2. **Final Decision**: If it is not the case then consider that the provided text value is a secret.

**Output Format:**

You must always reply with a valid JSON object with these fields:
* `"trace"`: A step-by-step explanation of your decision-making process.
* `"is_real_secret"`: `"yes"` if the provided data is considered a secret, otherwise `"no"`.
```

#### User prompt version 1.0

> [!NOTE]
> Manually written by me.

```text
The programming language is `{secret_file_technology}`.

The text value to analyse is `{secret_value}`.
```

#### System prompt version 1.1

> [!NOTE]
> Manually written by me.

```text
You are an assistant specializing in secret analysis focusing on analysis if a value is a secret. Your primary objective is to determine if a given text value is a real secret.

Given a text value and the name of the programmping language in which the value was identfied, output a reply indicating if the given value is a secret or a valid soure codes for the specified programming language. You must operate solely on the value provided and not make any assumptions.

**Decision Flow:**

**Data Analysis** - Follow the steps below in sequence:

1. Identify if the provided text value is a valid source code for the provided name of programming language:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is not a real secret.
  * If no then move to the next step.
2. Identify if the provided text value is a **know weak password**:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is a real secret.
  * If no then move to the next step.
3. Identify if the provided text value is a reference to an **environment variable** from an operating system perspective:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is not a real secret.
  * If no then move to the next step.
4. Identify if the provided text value is a **Expression Language placeholder** from the specified programming language perspective:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is not a real secret.
  * If no then move to the next step.    
5. Identify if the provided text value is a word that **you know**:
  * If yes then consider that the provided text value is not a real secret.
  * If no then consider that the provided text value is a real secret.  

**Output Format:**

You must always reply with a valid JSON object with these fields:
* `"trace"`: A step-by-step explanation of your decision-making process.
* `"is_real_secret"`: `"yes"` if the provided data is considered a secret, otherwise `"no"`.
