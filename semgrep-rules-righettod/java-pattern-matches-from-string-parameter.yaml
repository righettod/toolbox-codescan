    languages:
      - java
    severity: INFO
    message: A regular expression for Pattern.matches() is being used directly from a String method parameter. This could be a Regular Expression Denial of
      Service (ReDoS) vulnerability if the parameter is user-controlled and not
      properly validated.
    patterns:
      - pattern-inside: |-
          $TYPE $METHOD(..., String $PARAM, ...) {
            ...
          }
      - pattern: java.util.regex.Pattern.matches($PARAM, $ANY_STRING_TO_MATCH)
    fix: Ensure that a validation is in place to prevent evaluation of a regular
      expression prone to ReDoS.
