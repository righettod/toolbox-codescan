    severity: WARNING
    message: The tag "http-method" is used to specify on which HTTP methods the java
      web security constraint apply. The target security constraints could be
      bypassed if a non list HTTP method is used.
    pattern: <http-method>$X</http-method>
    fix: Inverse the logic by using the tag "http-method-omission" to define for
      which HTTP methods the security constraint do not apply. Using this way,
      only expected allowed HTTP methods will be skipped by the security
      constraint.
